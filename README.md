# House-Price-Prediction-Kaggle:
Competition Description: Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.  With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

# Major Steps Taken:
1) checking missing data
2) Checking Skewness and removing outliers 
3) Indetifing Corelations in Features
4) Categorising Features
5) manupilating missing data according to feature categoty and Importance
6) Using encoder for catagories
7) Hyperparameter optimisation
8) Using XG Boosting and Regressor
9) Predition with All Features
10) Predition with only Highly corelated feartures
11) Addded both preditions to dataset



### In this Dataset , I didnt had the Ideal values of output, So I was not able to check accurecy. But I could have checked it with RMSE values.
